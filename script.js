// I want a timed quiz on JS fundamentals that stores the highest scores to gauge progress against peers

//I want a start button that when clicked will begin a timer and present a question

// when I answer a question

// present the next question

// when a question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock

// when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over
